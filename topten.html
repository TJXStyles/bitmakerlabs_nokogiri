 One thing I ask you

 Let me be the one you bet that ass to

 Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu

 Swag on, even when you dress casual

 I mean it's almost unbearable

 Then, honey you're not there when I'm

 With my foresight b*tch you pay me by

 Nothing like your leg, I ain't too square for you

 I'll smack that ass and pull your hair like that
<br>
 So I jail watch, hand wave for you to salute
<br>
 But you didn't pick
<br>
 Not many women get repeated pimpin' (?)

 I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused with (?)

 Shake around

 Get up

<br>
Return of the Mack - get up
<br>
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’
t
<br>
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
<br>
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
<br>
We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
<br>
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
<br>
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, Sweater Gang
<br>
Nope, Nope. y’all can’t copy that
<br>
Bad, moonwalkin', This here, is our party
<br>
My posse's been on broadway, and we did it our way
<br>
Grown music
<br>
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
<br>
And yet I’m on
<br>
Let that stage light go and shine on down
<br>
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
<br>
Money
<br>
Stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
<br>
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
<br>
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustling
<br>
Chasing dreams since I was 14
<br>
With the 4 track, bussing
<br>
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit
<br>
Labels out here, nah they can’t tell me nothing
<br>
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
<br>
Labels out here, nah they can’t tell me nothing
<br>
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
<br>
<br>
[Hook x2 Ray Dalton]
<br>
And then we go back, this is the moment
<br>
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
<br>
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
<br>
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Macklemore]
<br>
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
<br>
Yeah I’m so damn grateful
<br>
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
<br>
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
<br>
Y’all can’t stop me, I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heart beat
<br>
And I’m eating at the beat
<br>
Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
<br>
(Why? Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces, goodbye
<br>
I've got a world to see;
<br>
And my girl, She wanna see Rome
<br>
Caesar'll make you a believer
<br>
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
<br>
That validation comes
<br>
So I'm giving it back to the people now
<br>
Sing that song and it goes like...
<br>
Raise those hands, this is our party
<br>
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
<br>
I got my city right behind me;
<br>
If I fall they got me
<br>
Learn from that failure, gain humility
<br>
Then we keep marching, I said
<br>
<br>
[Hook x2 Ray Dalton]
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
And all my people say'

"Na na NAna na naNA na"

<p id="songLyricsDiv" ondragstart="return false;" onselectstart="return false;" oncontextmenu="return false;" class="songLyricsV14">[Verse 1]
<br>
Aren't you somethin' to admire
<br>
Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
<br>
And I can't help but notice
<br>
You reflect in this heart of mine
<br>
If you ever feel alone and
<br>
The glare makes me hard to find
<br>
Just know that I'm always
<br>
Parallel on the other side
<br>
<br>
[Pre-Hook]
<br>
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
<br>
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
<br>
Just put your hand on the past
<br>
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
<br>
You just gotta be strong
<br>
<br>
[Hook 1]
<br>
Cause I don't wanna lose you now
<br>
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
<br>
The biggest scene is set in my heart
<br>
There's a space, but now you're home
<br>
Show me how to fight for now
<br>
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
<br>
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
<br>
You were right here all along
<br>
It's like you're my mirror
<br>
My mirror staring back at me
<br>
I couldn't get any bigger
<br>
With anyone else beside me
<br>
And now it's clear as this promise
<br>
That we're making
<br>
Two reflections into one
<br>
Cause it's like you're my mirror
<br>
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Aren't you somethin', an original
<br>
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple
<br>
And I can't help but stare, cause
<br>
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
<br>
I can't ever change without you
<br>
You reflect me, I love that about you
<br>
And if I could, I
<br>
Would look at us all the time
<br>
<br>
[Pre-Hook]
<br>
<br>
[Hook]
<br>
<br>
[Break]
<br>
Yesterday is history
<br>
Tomorrow's a mystery
<br>
I can see you lookin' back at me
<br>
Keep your eyes on me
<br>
Baby, keep your eyes on me
<br>
<br>
[Hook]
<br>
<br>
[Hook 2]
<br>
You are, you are the love of my life
<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]
<br>
Baby, you're the inspiration of this precious song
<br>
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
<br>
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
<br>
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
<br>
Just to let you know, you are
<br>
<br>
[Hook 2]
<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]
<br>
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
<br>
My reflection, in everything I do

You're my reflection and all I see is you

My reflection, in everything I do

Baby you a song
<br>
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
<br>
<br>
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up
<br>
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up
<br>
<br>
Yea when I first saw that bikini top on her
<br>
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
<br>
Thought ol' good Lord, she had them long tanned legs
<br>
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
<br>
<br>
Baby you a song
<br>
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
<br>
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
<br>
Every little farm town with you
<br>
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
<br>
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
<br>
So baby you a song
<br>
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
<br>
<br>
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up
<br>
<br>
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
<br>
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
<br>
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck
<br>
And said, "Fire it up! Let's go get this thing stuck!"
<br>
<br>
Baby you a song
<br>
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

<br>
My windows down, my seats back
<br>
My music up and we ride
<br>
Her legs up on my dashboard
<br>
And it's just the way I like
<br>
Hey country girl, this country boy
<br>
Like everything about you
<br>
Don't change a thing, no way
<br>
You stay the same and I got you
<br>
I like saw that, all that
<br>
Head to toe you all that
<br>
Tell ol' boy he can call back
<br>
Send her a text say, "fall back" cause
<br>
I can see you got a thing for the fast life
<br>
So come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like
<br>
Whipping 'cross the border, Florida into Georgia
<br>
<br>
Cause baby you a song
<br>
And you make me wanna roll my, roll my...

Limo tint rollin' deep like the President<br>
See, I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch<br>
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse<br><br>
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate<br>
Return of the Top Dogg and ain't no stoppin' this<br>
Whatever the case, I ain't tryin' to catch it<br>
Lay low, blow big dope and slang records<br><br>
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb<br>
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word<br>
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge<br>
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke<br><br>
I bring the worst from the L.B.C.<br>
Smash motherfuckers, thinkin' they gon' smash on me<br>
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say<br>
From the 'World's Most Dangerous Group', N.W.A, ay, ay<br><br>
Our rise, it was no surprise<br>
I always knew these fools would trip<br>
Hatin', fakin', schemin' on mine<br>
And on the down low, talkin' shit<br><br>
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose<br>
No matter which damn road I choose<br>
So lay low 'cause you might be bruised<br>
Top story on the evening news<br><br>
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em, lay low<br>
Lay down on the floor<br>
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this, let me know<br>
That's what I came fo'<br><br>
Where that nigga who be talkin' shit?<br>
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch<br>
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezin' the tits<br>
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips<br><br>
She tried to make me cum but I was tryin' to take her home<br>
Dropped you off and seen you fishin' on your raggedy Brougham<br>
Coulda thumped you and the dog, you little fag<br>
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong<br><br>
Booyaka, booyaka, we bring it straight to ya<br>
From 22's to Luger's, the shit that shoot through ya<br>
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with?<br>
The same click he came with and made the game flip<br><br>
Now niggaz grow they hair, hope they stayin', act hard<br>
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit, get slapped hard<br>
The backyard is where we get our scrap on<br>
The black car drive by then you get capped on<br><br>
Whassup pimpin'? It's P and Snoop<br>
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nuttin' but loot<br>
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got<br>
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got<br><br>
I keeps it real-ah 'cause I'm all about my scrilla<br>
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dolla hitta<br>
It's, No Limit 'til I D-I-E<br>
C-P-3 or Richmond, Cali's where I be<br><br>
For the nigga who be talkin' loud and holdin' his dick<br>
Talkin' shit, he better lay low<br>
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick<br>
Now she sick, she better lay low<br><br>
For the niggaz who be claimin' my hood<br>
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low<br>
I hope he don't be thinkin', I'm just talkin'<br>
And I won't do a thing, really hope so<br></p>		</div>

Come<br>
Come<br>
If U're 18 and over, come here 
<br>
I got something 4 your mind 
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Come) {repeat in song} 
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHORUS: 
<br>
U should do that, baby - no more will U cry 
<br>
The spirit's calling, here's a reason why 
<br>
If U had a chance 2 see the future, would U try? 
<br>
If U will, so will I 
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I call U up, I wanna tell U what 2 wear 
<br>
Don't be surprised if I tell U 2 go bare 
<br>
Long as U wash between your soul and through your hair 
<br>
(I'm gonna do it) I'll do my duty there, oh 
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHORUS 
<br>
<br>
<br>
(When U) When I lay U down, I wanna tell U what 2 feel 
<br>
(Don't U) Don't be surprised if I make U my daily meal 
<br>
Lickin' U inside, outside, all sides up and down 
<br>
With my tongue in the crease, baby, I go round when I go down, down, down, down... 
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I do U, no more will U cry 
<br>
The spirit's calling, here's a reason why 
<br>
If U had the chance 2 see the future, would U try? 
<br>
If U will, so will I, so will I 
<br>
<br>
<br>
U should do that, baby 
<br>
U should do that, girl 
<br>
U should do that, baby 
<br>
U should do that, girl 
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I suck U there, I don't wanna hear U scream 
<br>
Don't talk or breathe, don't cough or sneeze (Achoo!) 
<br>
Oh, just dream, dream, dream 
<br>
Baby, huh, my tongue's gonna do things that U've never seen 
<br>
Oh girl 
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I blow that mind, baby 
<br>
I'm gonna drive U crazy 
<br>
<br>
<br>
U should do that, girl (No more will U cry) 
<br>
U should do that, baby (Here's a reason why) 
<br>
(If U had the chance 2 see the future, would U try?) 
<br>
(Do that girl, do that girl) 
<br>
U should do that, baby (If U will, so will I) 
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Come on, come on, come on - no more will U cry) 
<br>
(Here's a reason why) 
<br>
(If U had the chance 2 see the future, would U try?) 
<br>
(If U will, so will I) 
<br>
Now break it down 
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I blow that mind, baby 
<br>
I'm gonna drive U crazy 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Can I suck U, baby? 
<br>
Can I fuck U, baby? 
<br>
I wanna suck U, baby 
<br>
Shout it out! 
<br>
<br>
<br>
(No more will U cry) 
<br>
(Here's a reason why) 
<br>
And if U had a chance 2 see the future, would U try? 
<br>
Oh, if U will, if U will, so will I (If U will, so will I) 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Like a splendid, open-ended, celibate friend pretending 
<br>
(No more will U cry) 
<br>
Not 2 know it when I blow it in your eyes 
<br>
(Here's a reason why) 
<br>
Like a strawberry, chocolate, fender jazz, mashed potato fuzztone 
<br>
All over your thighs, oh baby 
<br>
That's the only come I know when I'm deep inside that... yeah! 
<br>
That's the only time, the only time U go 
<br>
"Ooh baby, U're so good" {x2} 
<br>
Aw, shut up! 
<br>
This is just so U 
<br>
Come {x3} 
<br>
<br>
<br>
No more will U cry 
<br>
<br>
<br>
It's no wonder there's a puddle there, holding it in 4 so long 
<br>
U know U can let it go, it won't be wrong 
<br>
It's just U and me, baby, 2night and 4ever more 
<br>
U should do that, baby - fuck it on the floor 
<br>
Or better yet, why don't U do it on the chair? 
<br>
U should get that shit started, U can change your underwear 
<br>
Yeah, U can always change your underwear 
<br>
<br>
<br>
It don't mean U're wrecked cuz U kiss in a restaurant 
<br>
It don't mean U're wrecked just cuz me tallywhacker suckin' is all U want 
<br>
All it means is that the one that come before me never made U come 
<br>
U should do that, baby 
<br>
Do that, baby {x3} 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me suck U 
<br>
Don't scream 
<br>
Don't talk 
<br>
Don't breathe 
<br>
Just lay back {x2} 
<br>
Just lay back and dream 
<br>
Dream {x3} 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah 
<br>
Oh love 
<br>
Did U come, come, come, come? 
<br>
I wanna know 
<br>
(U should do that, baby) U should do that, baby 
<br>
Oh yes (Oh yes), oh yes 
<br>
Come - U should do that, baby (Do that, girl) 
<br>
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah... ! (Oh yeah) 
<br>
<br>
<br>
No more, no more (No more will U cry) 
<br>
Will U cry, cry, cry, cry (Here's a reason why) 
<br>
If U had the chance 2 see the future, would U try? 
<br>
If U will, if U will, so will I (Come, come, come, come) 
<br>
(Do that, baby) 
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I blow that mind, baby 
<br>
I'm gonna drive U crazy

<br>
What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top.
<br>
<br>
I love the way you make me feel
<br>
I love it, I love it
<br>
I love the way you make me feel
<br>
I love it, I love it
<br>
<br>
Say, I’m thinking ’bout her every second, every hour
<br>
Do my singing in the shower
<br>
Picking petals off the flowers like
<br>
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
<br>
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)
<br>
<br>
You give me that kind of something
<br>
Want it all the time, need it everyday
<br>
On a scale of one to ten I’m at 100
<br>
Never get enough, I can’t stay away
<br>
<br>
If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
<br>
You can get whatever you need from me
<br>
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
<br>
And I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper
<br>

So don’t you worry, baby, you got me

<br>
When you put your lips on mine
<br>
And honey it ain’t a question (q-question)
<br>
Cause boy I know just what you like
<br>
<br>
So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
<br>
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
